# Sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews
Sentiment analysis is most widely used in NLP to extract and observe opinions of an individual or a group of people based on their own words or on their perspective
or views on certain incidents, which could be based on a social media post, a review on a movie or even a feedback for a product purchased online. 
This technique can directly be used to predict the emotions conveyed by the text like whether it is positive or negative. In this work, a comparative analysis of the impact 
of various machine learning and ensemble models is presented for Sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Feature extraction methods are also used to reduce the dimensions 
of the input dataset and to select the most important features which ultimately improved the overall accuracy. Several classification models like Logistic regression, 
support vector classifier and Random Forest have been implemented along with boosting and stacking ensemble models. The results obtained show that sentimental analysis 
for movie reviews using ensemble models has higher accuracy when compared to other models. The dataset used for experimentation is the NLTK dataset for sentiment analysis 
of movie reviews.
